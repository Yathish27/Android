                "Experts Say : You alone know where the chilli powder and turmeric are kept. And where the knives and plates are. All these can be turned into eadly weapons. If nothing else, start throwing plates and utensils all over. Let them break. Scream... Remember that noise is the greatest enemy of a molester. He does not want to be caught. \n" +
                "3. Taking an Auto or Taxi at Night. \n" +
                "Experts Say : Before getting into an auto at night, note down its registration number. Then use the mobile to call your family or friend and pass on the details to them in the language the driver understands. Even if no one answers your call, pretend you are in a conversation. The driver now knows someone has his details and he will be in serious trouble if anything goes wrong. He is now bound to take you home safe and sound. A potential attacker is now your de facto protector. \n" +
                "4. What if the driver turns into a street he is not supposed too and you feel you are entering a danger zone . \n" +
                "Experts Say : Use the handle of your purse or your stole (dupatta) to wrap around his neck and pull him back. Within seconds, he will feel choked and helpless. In case you don't have a purse or stole just pull him back by his collar. The top button of his shirt would then do the same trick.\n" +
